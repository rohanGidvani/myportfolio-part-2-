           My name is Rohan and I like to code, play tennis and video games. I am 14 and I am going into 9th grade. 
           I have many friends and I like to hang out with them on the weekends and during the weekdays because we play basketball
           and do other stuff. School is sometimes easy but usually is hard because of all the classwork we get everyday. My favorite
           class is math because we always learn something new everyday which makes the day feel more productive. On weekends sometimes I stay up late
           and sleep in because it is more fun to that unlike sleepign early and wakign up early which I used to do.
